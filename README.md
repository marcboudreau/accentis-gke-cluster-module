gke-cluster
===========

This repository contains a Terraform Module that provisions a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster and any per-cluster supporting resources.

The set of resources defined in this project must be easily destructible and re-creatable.  Resources that have a soft-delete behaviour (e.g., IAM Role) cannot be defined in this module.
